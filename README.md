---

## 💡 TL;DR

> **OpenClaw-RL** is a fully asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that turns everyday conversations into training signals for personalized AI agents, and supports training general agents with large-scale environment parallelization.

Most RL-for-LLM systems assume centralized, batch-mode training with pre-collected datasets. **OpenClaw-RL** takes a fundamentally different approach: it wraps your self-hosted model in [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) as an OpenAI-compatible API, intercepts live multi-turn conversations, and continuously optimizes the policy in the background — all without interrupting your usage.

</p>



> **Highlights:** Fully async 4-component loop · Self-hosted & private · Zero manual labeling · Three learning paradigms (Binary RL / OPD / Combine) · Personal + General agent support

<details>
<summary><b>🌈 Features</b></summary>

### Fully Asynchronous 4-Component Architecture
OpenClaw-RL decouples **agent serving**, **rollout collection**, **PRM/judge evaluation**, and **policy training** into independent async loops. None of them block one another: the model continues serving requests while training runs in the background, and judging happens concurrently with new interactions.

### Self-Hosted & Private by Design
The entire stack, including the **policy model**, **judge/PRM**, and **trainer**, runs on **your own infrastructure**. Conversation data stays within your system, and no third-party model API is required.

### From Feedback to Gradient — Automatically
You do not need to manually label data. The system automatically:
- Organizes multi-turn interactions into session-aware training trajectories
- Classifies API messages into **main-line** (trainable) vs. **side** (non-trainable) turns
- Uses the next user, environment, or tool feedback as a natural "next-state" signal
- Runs PRM/judge evaluation asynchronously, with majority voting when needed for more robust scoring
- Submits ready samples to the trainer as they become available

### Three Optimization Methods in One Framework

**Binary RL (GRPO):** A Process Reward Model scores each turn based on next-state feedback. The scalar reward is then used with GRPO advantage estimation and a PPO-style clipped surrogate loss.

**On-Policy Distillation (OPD):** When the next state reveals useful hindsight, a judge model extracts a textual hint. This hint augments the original prompt to create an enhanced teacher, whose token-level log-probability gap with the student becomes a directional advantage signal richer than any scalar reward.

**Combination Method:** OpenClaw-RL further combines Binary RL and OPD in a unified training recipe, leveraging the dense scalar supervision of Binary RL together with the richer token-level directional signal from OPD. This combination achieves stronger and more robust optimization than either method alone.

### From Personal Agents to Real-World Agentic RL
The same framework supports both personalized OpenClaw optimization and scalable RL for **terminal**, **GUI**, **SWE**, and **tool-call** agents in real-world settings.

<summary><b>📋 Full contribution guidelines & feature wishlist</b></summary>


# Call for Contributions

We welcome community contributions to OpenClaw-RL! This document outlines our contribution principles and the features we'd love help with.

## Contribution Guidelines

OpenClaw-RL is organized as a collection of **self-contained method folders** (e.g., `openclaw-rl/`, `openclaw-opd/`, `openclaw-combine/`), each sitting alongside the shared `slime/` training framework and `openclaw/` runtime.

Contributions generally fall into two categories:

### Adding a new method or deployment target

Create a new top-level folder (parallel to existing ones like `openclaw-opd/`). All method-specific code — launch scripts, custom loss functions, rollout logic, API server adapters, data processing, and the README — should live inside this folder.

### Extending an existing method

For changes within an existing method folder — such as supporting a new model family, adding a LoRA variant, or a low-precision example — **add new files** (e.g., a new `.sh` script, a new data processing script) rather than modifying existing ones. This way the original working examples stay intact and your addition can be reviewed independently.

### General principles

1. **Do not modify the core framework.** Avoid changes to `slime/`, `Megatron-LM/`, or `openclaw/` unless absolutely necessary. The framework exposes extension points (`--custom-loss-function-path`, `--rollout-function-path`, `--custom-generate-function-path`, `--custom-rm-path`, etc.) specifically so that new methods can plug in without touching shared code. If a framework change is truly needed, please open a separate PR for it with a clear justification.

2. **Include documentation.** For a new method folder, add a `README.md` explaining what the method does, how to run it, key environment variables, and file structure. For additions to existing folders, update the existing `README.md` with a new section. See [`openclaw-combine/README.md`](./openclaw-combine/README.md) or [`toolcall-rl/README.md`](./toolcall-rl/README.md) for good examples.

3. **Follow existing conventions.** Use the same shell script structure (GPU partitioning, `CKPT_ARGS`, `ROLLOUT_ARGS`, `OPTIMIZER_ARGS`, etc.), environment variable naming, and `ray job submit` launch pattern used by the existing methods.





## Highly Preferred Features

### 1. ☁️ Deploy Training on [Tinker](https://thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/)   

**Type:** New method folder

**Goal:** Add a new top-level folder (e.g., `tinker/`) that provides a turnkey example for running OpenClaw-RL training on the Tinker cloud platform.

**Requirements:**

- A new self-contained folder at the repo root, following the same structure as other method folders.
- A launch script that adapts GPU allocation, Ray setup, and networking for the Tinker environment.
- The recommended training method is the **combination loss** (`openclaw-combine`), as it achieves the best results in our experiments. The example should either import or replicate the combination loss setup.
- A `README.md` covering: Tinker-specific prerequisites, step-by-step setup, how to configure checkpoints and data paths on Tinker, and how to connect OpenClaw to the running server.


### 2. 🤖 Qwen3.5 Model Support 

**Type:** Extend existing method folders

**Goal:** Add launch scripts and model configurations for the Qwen3.5 family across existing methods.

**Requirements:**

- Add new `.sh` scripts for Qwen3.5 in relevant method folders (e.g., `openclaw-combine/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_combine.sh`).
- Add the corresponding model config in `slime/scripts/models/` if Qwen3.5 requires different architecture parameters (hidden size, num layers, etc.) from Qwen3.
- Verify and document any changes needed for tokenizer, chat template, reasoning parser, or tool-call parser compatibility.
- Update READMEs to list Qwen3.5 as a supported model.


### 3. 🔧 LoRA Training & Low-Precision Training/Inference Examples 

**Type:** Extend existing method folders

**Goal:** Add LoRA fine-tuning and low-precision (e.g., INT8/INT4 inference, BF16/FP8 training) example scripts to existing method folders, enabling users to run OpenClaw-RL on consumer-grade hardware with fewer GPUs.

**Requirements:**

- Add **new** `.sh` scripts within existing method folders (e.g., `openclaw-combine/run_qwen3_4b_lora.sh`, `openclaw-rl/run_qwen3_4b_lora.sh`) — do not modify existing scripts.
- LoRA training: demonstrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning with configurable rank, alpha, and target modules. Should work with 2–4 GPUs.
- Low-precision inference: demonstrate launching the SGLang rollout engine with quantized weights (e.g., AWQ/GPTQ INT4) to reduce VRAM for the serving side.
- Low-precision training: if supported by the Megatron backend, demonstrate FP8 or mixed-precision configurations that reduce training memory.
- Update the corresponding `README.md` in each method folder with a new section documenting these scripts.

## 🔧 Personal Agent Optimization Quick Start

### 1. RL Server Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** 8× GPUs (default; configurable via `NUM_GPUS`, `ACTOR_GPUS`, `ROLLOUT_GPUS`, `PRM_GPUS`)
- **Software:** CUDA 12.9, Python 3.12
- **Framework:** [Slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) (our base RL framework)

For detailed environment setup, see [Slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) or [`./instructions/README.md`](./instructions/README.md).








### 2. Start the RL Server

We provide three methods (RL servers):

| Dimension | [Binary RL](./openclaw-rl/) | [OPD](./openclaw-opd) | [Combined](./openclaw-combine) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal type | Evaluative (good / bad) | Directional | Evaluative + directional |
| Advantage | Sequence-level scalar | Token-level directional | Mixed sequence and token-level |
| Density | All scored turns | Hint-accepted turns only | All scored turns |
| Feedback type | User / environment | Explicit corrections | Both implicit and explicit feedback |
| Signal richness | 1 scalar per sample | 1 value per token | 1 value per token |



Choose your optimization method:

<a id="combinemethod"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Option A: Combination Method</b> — Recommended !</summary>

```bash
cd slime
bash ../openclaw-combine/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_combine.sh
```

This method combines binary RL and OPD to achieve the best optimization.

See [`./openclaw-combine/README.md`](./openclaw-combine/README.md) for algorithm details.
</details>


<a id="binaryrlmethod"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Option B: Binary RL</b> — Best for implicit feedback (likes/dislikes, env success/failure)</summary>

```bash
cd slime
bash ../openclaw-rl/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_rl.sh
```

The PRM will automatically judge response quality from next-state feedback. We recommend providing frequent feedback (e.g., 👍/👎) to help the model optimize effectively.

See [`./openclaw-rl/README.md`](./openclaw-rl/README.md) for algorithm details.
</details>


<a id="opdmethod"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Option C: On-Policy Distillation (OPD)</b> — Best for rich textual feedback</summary>

```bash
cd slime
bash ../openclaw-opd/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_opd.sh
```

The system extracts hindsight hints from your feedback and distills them into the policy at the token level. We recommend providing concrete feedback (e.g., "you should have checked the file first" or "don't use that library").

See [`./openclaw-opd/README.md`](./openclaw-opd/README.md) for algorithm details.
</details>

Once running, the model is served as an OpenAI-compatible API at:
```
http://<HOST_IP>:30000/v1
```

where `<HOST_IP>` is the **IP address** of the machine running the RL server (e.g. `115.190.98.251`). The port `30000` is the default and can be changed via the `PORT` environment variable.

**Take note of this endpoint** — you will need it when configuring OpenClaw in the next step.

We also provide an interesting case for evaluation. A student who uses OpenClaw to do homework, does not want to be found using AI. A teacher who also uses OpenClaw to grade student's homework, wants the comments to be specific and friendly.

<a id="evalmethod"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Eval Setting</b> — Both student and teacher use AI!</summary>

We find that, under the combined optimization method, OpenClaw needs only 36 problem-solving interactions in the student setting and 24 grading interactions in the teacher setting to achieve a significant and clearly visible improvement.

See [`./openclaw-test/README.md`](./openclaw-test/README.md) for setup and algorithm details.
</details>


### 3. OpenClaw Setup

Install OpenClaw from the version bundled in this repository (we will update it regularly):

<details>
<summary><b>Then configure OpenClaw to route requests to your RL server. </b></summary>

Open your `openclaw.json` (or the equivalent settings file) and add a provider entry under `"models"` → `"providers"`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "qwen": {
        "baseUrl": "http://<HOST_IP>:30000/v1",
        "apiKey": "apiKey",
        "api": "openai-completions",
        "models": [
          {
            "id": "qwen3-4b",
            "name": "Qwen3 4B",
            "reasoning": true,
            "input": ["text"],
            "cost": {
              "input": 0,
              "output": 0,
              "cacheRead": 0,
              "cacheWrite": 0
            },
            "contextWindow": 32768,
            "maxTokens": 8192
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<HOST_IP>` with the IP address of your RL server machine. The `apiKey` should match the `SGLANG_API_KEY` you set when starting the server.

That's it — start chatting with your OpenClaw agent. The RL server will automatically collect conversation trajectories, compute rewards, and train the model. Your agent gets better the more you use it.

</details>

#### Configurations

Before launching, set these important environment variables as needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NUM_GPUS` | `8` | Total GPUs available on the machine |
| `ACTOR_GPUS` | `4` | GPUs allocated to the training actor |
| `ROLLOUT_GPUS` | `2` | GPUs allocated to rollout generation |
| `PRM_GPUS` | `2` | GPUs allocated to the Process Reward Model |
| `HF_CKPT` | (see script) | Path to the base HuggingFace checkpoint |
| `PRM_MODEL_PATH` | (see script) | Path to the reward model HuggingFace checkpoint |
| `SAVE_CKPT` | (see script) | Path to the saved HuggingFace checkpoint |
| `SGLANG_API_KEY` | — | API key for the SGLang serving endpoint |

You can check more details about configurations in [`./instructions`](./instructions) .
